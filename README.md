Repo Rules

1. Diff Everything
Before committing any changes to the repo, be sure to diff all of the files you're committing and ensure no mistakes are being submitted to the repo.

2. Small, Frequent Commits
Committing small, or even singular changes to the repo is wise. It allows for easy diffing, easy commit messages, and easy reversion should a major bug arise. 

3. Good Commit Messages
Commit messages should describe what the code change accomplished and why the code was changed. Commit messages should make clear why a given logical chunk of code was added to the repo. 

4. Use Feature Branches
If you'll be making multiple commits around a given feature, and likely that will be the case, then create a new branch and build your new feature on the branch, when you're done the feature, merge it back to master. Using branches makes the merge back into master feel significant and concrete. It also means we can keep the master clean, only committing top-quality, working code to the master branch, allowing it to always be deployable.
